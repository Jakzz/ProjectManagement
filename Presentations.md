#### Guidelines
- Be a team player - Try to find/use/make a standard company template + Brand theme
- Headlines not titles - e.g. "Mobile search will double in 2 years" vs "Mobile search" (24pt++)
- Limit text - One idea per slide, instead:
- Highlights - Use contrasting background colours to highlight a partular point or slide e.g. key concepts of risks
- Pictures are good - but be smart, use Google and Creative Commons licences, don't rely on dated built-in clip-art
- Clean data - use visualisations, but perfect cross-sectional clarity is too much
- Don't dance - If you are using transitions and effects to be interesting, work more on your content
- Embed video (where possible)
